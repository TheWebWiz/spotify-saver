# Spotify Saver

## Updates

### Update 1

The app has been created and I am working on it now!

## Description

In this project, I will be building a React web application called Spotify Saver. I am using my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. If you have any questions or would like to contact me please do so at thewebwizard@outlook.com.

## Features(In order to be released)

### 1. Stage One

Allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Use/Downloading

Currently this application is only in development and cannot be used. Please wait for the first milestone to be released.

## Technologies

I am using a standard HTML/CSS(SASS)/JavaScript/React stack to build this app. As I reach for more technologies I will update this form.
